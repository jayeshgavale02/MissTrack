# üìÅ **MissTrack: Missing Persons Tracking System**

## üìù **Overview**
**TrackP** is an advanced AI-driven project designed to tackle the growing issue of missing persons globally. It leverages cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze video surveillance footage and image datasets for precise facial recognition. The system performs geospatial analysis to narrow down search areas, providing law enforcement agencies with real-time alerts and geolocation data.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**
- **Facial Recognition**  
   Uses machine learning models to identify faces from surveillance footage.
  
- **Geolocation Tracking**  
   Analyzes longitude and latitude data to assist in locating missing persons.

- **AI/ML Model Training**  
   Implements supervised learning with labeled data for more accurate predictions.

- **CCTV Surveillance Integration**  
   Continuously scans real-time footage to detect potential matches.

- **Alert System**  
   Sends real-time notifications to law enforcement with detailed information.

## üß† **How It Works**
1. **Facial Recognition**  
   The system processes video surveillance footage to detect faces using pre-trained machine learning models. Once a face is detected, it is matched with known datasets for identification.

2. **Geospatial Analysis**  
   Longitude and latitude data from mobile devices or surveillance cameras are analyzed to pinpoint the potential location of a missing person.

3. **AI/ML Model Training**  
   The system is trained on labeled data (images of known missing persons) to enhance the accuracy of facial recognition and improve predictions.

4. **CCTV Surveillance Integration**  
   The system integrates with real-time CCTV feeds to monitor and alert authorities when a match is detected.

5. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   Notifications are sent to law enforcement with detailed geolocation information, enabling quicker responses and aiding in the search efforts.
